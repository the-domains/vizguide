# Introduction

The objective of this
memorandum is to summarize the current state of data visualization, both in
transportation and outside of the industry. We will first provide examples and
resources within a framework consistent with an ideal visualization development
process. Second, we will summarize the outcomes and takeaways from interviews
of subject matter experts. Third, we will provide an annotated bibliography
documenting our broad set of visualization examples and resources.

## The Project

What are we doing?

Our purpose in performing this research is to evaluate
data visualization methods and their applicability to transportation planning
and analysis. Our ultimate goal is to produce a Guide to assist transportation industry
professionals in selecting and applying visualization methods. This guide will
be published as a printed report, but also as an interactive website.

The first step in producing the Guide is to review the
current state of data visualization. We used the professional expertise of our
own team and contacts in the industry to guide our search. In addition, we
conducted interviews with subject matter experts and tone-setters in the
visualization field, both inside and outside of the transportation industry.

## The Rise of Visualization

Why is this important?

A visualization is any picture that conveys information.
It can be static, animated, or interactive, colorful or monochrome. It can
represent a conceptual framework (e.g., an organizational structure), a dataset
(e.g., census demographics), or a simple idea (e.g., the budget is _really_ big). As society's ability to collect,
store, and consume data has grown over time, so has the need to illustrate and
explain that information.

At the turn of the 21st Century, the term "visualization"in the transportation
industry almost always referred to static or animated renderings of improvement
projects, often animated and three-dimensional. As the last decade ended, the
proliferation of free public data from transit agencies among others changed
the popular conception. "Visualizations" evolved to include maps
and animations that could be consumed on multiple platforms and easily
understood by laypeople. This trend mirrors other industries, as journalists,
politicians, and corporations begin to produce animated and interactive
displays and integrate them into websites and smartphone apps.

While the growth of advanced, interactive visualizations
continues in transportation, the resources and expertise of many practitioners
has not. While an app developer or even a private citizen may possess the time
and skills to take on an intensive visualization project, organizations such as
state transportation agencies, Metropolitan Planning Organizations, local
governments, and advocacy groups often do not. 

For these practitioners, a "visualization"may be a static pie chart,
bar graph, or diagram, integrated into printed text. While there is no limit to
the types of information that can be conveyed visually, common uses for
practitioners might include:

* Deterioration curves showing how a condition
metric falls over time;
* Ridership or occupancy over time for a transit
service;
* Volume over time for a roadway or intersection;
* Benefits of a project compared to costs;
* Flows of funding from revenue sources to
expenditures; and
* Maps: trip generation, rider origin and
destination, transportation equity (service level vs. income level), and
roadway congestion, among many others.

We will address advanced tools for developing interactive,
web-based products, we will also lay a foundation for practitioners with
simpler needs or preferences to produce attractive and effective visualizations.

## Outline

How is this document structured?

The first section of this document provides examples and
resources that address each stage of the development process for
visualizations. These stages are:

* Concept and Planning;
* Data Wrangling;
* Choosing a Strategy;
* Effective Design; and
* Tools and Implementation.

The second section includes takeaways from interviews we
conducted both with acknowledged subject matter experts in visualization and
with practitioners recognized for visualizing transportation data.

This is not the first overview of data visualization, nor
is it the first guidance produced for visualization designers. We believe that
our work adds value by acknowledging the unique needs and challenges of
transportation practitioners as they seek to explain complex datasets to a
demanding set of stakeholders, as well as to each other.'
